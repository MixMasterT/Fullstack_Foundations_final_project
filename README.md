# Fullstack_Foundations_final_project
This is the final project for a course called "Fullstack Foundation" on Udacty

To check out this project, first make sure you have Vagrant, and VirtualBox installed properly.
If you don't want to use Vagrant and a virtual Machine, make sure you have flask, and the related moduels insalled in you python environment.

Then, run database_setup_final_project.py to create the database.

After that, run lots_of_menus.py to populate the database.

Finally, run final_project.py to get the server running, and you can view the database contents on localhost port 5000.

Send me a message if you have any problems running these!~)
